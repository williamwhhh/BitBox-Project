# COMP90015-Project

This project is a team-based uni project I did for the subject Distributed Systems. It is something like BitTorrent and DropBox where users from different devices can collaborate on a shared drive. The architecture of this project is like that it contains basic components such as File System Manager which monitors a given directory in the file system on a local machine for changes to files, a BitBox Peer that can relay these changes to another BitBox Peer on a remote machine, and a BitBox Client that can communicate to one of the BitBox Peer servers to see the current connecting peers and add or remove peers in the network. It was planned that there were more than one BitBox Peers together forming a P2P network and their communication mode were allowed to switch between UDP and TCP connections. To prevent security issues, the communications between the BitBox Client and a BitBox Peer are secured using private and public key cryptography.
